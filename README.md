## Computing diaper price

To run: `python diaper_price_comparison.py`. Based on prices from July 2024:
```
Annual cost for REDYPER: $4394.39
Annual cost for Pamper: $3232.03
Total diapers used per stage: [300, 810, 840, 2400, 1440, 1440, 360]
Cost per stage for REDYPER: [119, 303, 354, 1157, 810, 972, 270]
Cost per stage for Pamper: [103, 244, 290, 892, 698, 794, 208]
```

But this is not accounting for the carbon cost associated with landfill! To be continued...
